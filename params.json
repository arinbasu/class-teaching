Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Using GitHub for Mac, simply sync the repository to see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Instructions for Manual Set up\r\nPush a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nCan @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nCheck out the documentation at http://help.github.com/pages or contact support@github.com and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
